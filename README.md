I studied Environmental Policy and Planning at the University of Iowa and graduated in Spring 2022 with a B.S. in Environmental Policy and Planning.
My research interests span geographical analysis, statistics, environmental justice, energy policy, and urban ecology.
This is a repository of the work I did for Geospatial Programming, a course at the University of Iowa Geography Department.
You can e-mail me at grahamsandersfeld@gmail.com with questions. My resume is also in the repository.
